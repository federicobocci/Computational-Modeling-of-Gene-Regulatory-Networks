# Computational-Modeling-of-Gene-Regulatory-Networks

This repository contains the code used to generate the results presented in Bocci, Jia, Nie, Jolly, Onuchic, "*Theoretical and computational tools to model multistable gene regulatory networks*". We encourage to cite this publication if this code or your customization of the code make a contribution to your publication.

The code is organized in two jupyter notebooks that contain tutorials for:

1) Stochastic simulation of protein synthesis

2) Deterministic and stochastic simulation of bistable toggle switch

To use the code, you can download the repository and run the code locally on your machine. The *requirements.txt* file contains all the libraries that I installed in a my python virtual environment to run the code.

Feel free to reach out for questions and comments via email at fbocci@uci.edu
